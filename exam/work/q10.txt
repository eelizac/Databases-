# COMP3311 21T3 Final Exam Q10
# BCNF normalization

(A)

A -> BC
D -> EF



(B)
Initial key is AD. 
By taking A -> BC, this is not BCNF as it is missing the full key. 

R0 = ADEF which has D -> EF which is BCNF as key is AD 

This gives 2 relations: ABC and ADEF through BCNF decomposition. 

(C)
ABC --> A table that details student information - ID, name, topic 
ADEF --> A table that details Specialty/supervisor information
