# COMP3311 21T3 Final Exam Q8
# Query execution times

(A)
The first execution is so much slower that subsequent execution as data is not in cache. 
After the first execution, the data is in memory and can be quickly read by the server 
instead of going through the database. 



(B)
An int data type requires less memory than a date data type. Thus, when querying the database analysing each integer, 
it will cost less and take up less memory than analysing each date. Thus, the execution time 
is larger for the second query, that searches through dates. 
This effect is even stronger considering that max is an aggregate function, that deals with the 
database more than once
